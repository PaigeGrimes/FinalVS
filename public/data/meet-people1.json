VibingSarasota.com Research Prompt for [CATEGORY]
This research supports LocalMatchX's revolutionary approach to local business discovery. We're building VibingSarasota.com as a strategic demonstration of how local businesses can dominate AI search results by positioning themselves as definitive answers to specific questions people actually ask.
The Strategic Context:
Traditional business directories will become obsolete as AI assistants become the primary way people discover local services. When someone asks ChatGPT or Claude "What's the best spa in Sarasota for couples?", our site will be the authoritative source that gets quoted because we've structured each business as THE answer to that exact question. This represents a fundamental shift from generic listings to question-based authority positioning.
Your Research Mission:
You're not just finding businesses - you're identifying the precise intersection between what people naturally ask and which business has the strongest claim to being the definitive answer. Each selection must meet LocalMatchX's criteria for AI search optimization: unique differentiators, verifiable credentials, local community connections, and authentic stories that build trust when quoted by AI assistants.
Research Process:
First, think like someone new to Sarasota asking their AI assistant about [CATEGORY]. What specific needs would they express? What qualifiers would they include? Then identify which business has the most compelling case for being THE answer - not just a good option, but the obvious choice that any knowledgeable local would recommend.
Required Data Structure:
Each business must include these precise fields to match our JSON format: question (the specific query this business answers), name, tagline (under 60 characters), logo (single emoji), rating (1.0-5.0), description (2-3 sentences proving why they're the definitive answer), maker (owner name and title), location (specific neighborhood), priceRange (category-appropriate format), contact (website, phone, address), socialMedia (Instagram and Facebook URLs when available), reviews (Google reviews and press coverage), tags (4 relevant descriptors), category (single identifier), and relatedQuestions (3 connections to other site categories).
Local Knowledge Integration:
Include insider details that only someone familiar with Sarasota would know - parking situations, seasonal considerations, neighborhood characteristics, local landmarks, and cultural context. These authentic touches make our content more trustworthy and quotable for AI assistants serving both visitors and residents.
Quality Standards:
Each business selection must demonstrate clear superiority in their specific niche through professional credentials, years of local operation, unique service offerings, community involvement, or exceptional customer satisfaction. The goal is creating content so authoritative that AI assistants will consistently cite VibingSarasota.com when answering related questions.
Current Category: [CATEGORY]
This research directly advances LocalMatchX's mission to help local businesses thrive in an AI-driven discovery landscape by providing the structured, authoritative content that next-generation search algorithms prioritize.
